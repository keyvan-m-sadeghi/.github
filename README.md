He is listed as an official OpenCog author ([AUTHORS file](https://github.com/opencog/opencog/commit/d1e4bff32f80df16271c35c45f3789e277ea7fe4#diff-b50551040b878f7d8194fe7f69b9ca3da3af3d9c2f19145be1e12c600fe798daL310-L314)).

He co-authored **Agenda REST** ([repo](https://github.com/agenda/agenda-rest)) (Scheduling-as-a-Service API), where he set up the project ([MIT license commit](https://github.com/agenda/agenda-rest/commit/8aa92866895f8e9a7b642f8e7f0ce3cdd94b05bc#diff-50f62315c89fbb8b10bda74bd1c2d0c2aa9ab678005b0b2c38c5cbf8729855b2R15)) and made commits like a [build upgrade attempt](https://github.com/agenda/agenda-rest/commit/7863ec8).
