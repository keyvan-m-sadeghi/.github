  - **Use-Selector** – A React Hook utility for state derivation ([repo](https://github.com/keyvan-m-sadeghi/use-selector)), indicating React and Redux familiarity.  
  - *(Plus others)*: He has additional small packages and experimental repos (e.g., **assisterjs**, **asst** alias packages, **repin** tool, etc.), reflecting a broad exploratory coding practice.

Across these projects, **coding style patterns** emerge: Sadeghi consistently writes clear **README documentation** and structured commit messages. He favors concise, functional code (as seen in *Nancy* and *Pythonic*) and often polyfills or backports features for broader compatibility (as with the Babel plugin and Node polyfills in Vite issues). Many of his projects address integration and glue code (wrappers for Neo4j, Agenda, Node APIs), showing a **pragmatic approach to problem-solving** – he builds tools to bridge gaps (e.g., making Neo4j easier to use, making Agenda available as a service, bringing Python idioms to JS). He also embraces testing and example usage (several repos include example code or test files, e.g., Pythonic’s `test.js`, Nancy’s usage of asyncCounter). His technology preferences skew toward **JavaScript/Node.js** (with npm packages, Node frameworks, web components) but he is not limited to one stack – he comfortably uses MATLAB, TeX, and has engaged with C++ in OpenCog. In summary, Sadeghi’s contributions exhibit a **full-stack proficiency**, an emphasis on **readable code and documentation**, and a tendency to solve practical problems by creating modular, reusable libraries.

  <summary>Collaboration & Discussions</summary>

Beyond code commits, Keyvan M. Sadeghi is an active collaborator on GitHub. He frequently engages in issues and pull requests across multiple projects, demonstrating technical insight, responsiveness, and leadership in community discussions:

- **Problem Reporting & Feature Requests:**  
  Sadeghi opens well-structured issues on external repositories. For example, on PyTorch, he proposed adding a JavaScript/WebAssembly backend for trained models ([PyTorch Issue #25091](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/25091)). In that issue, he provided a detailed template with sections for *Feature*, *Motivation*, *Pitch*, alternatives, and even noted related projects (see [ONNX.js](https://github.com/onnx/onnx-js) and Rust/WASM considerations). This structured approach earned positive reactions from many users. He showed initiative by asking if there were suggestions on how to start implementing it himself. Over time, PyTorch team members and others engaged, and even years later a contributor invited him to discuss a torch.js proposal, indicating his feature request had lasting impact. Similarly, he reported a bug in Microsoft’s Office JavaScript API (*displayDialogAsync* issue) with clear reproduction steps and code snippets ([OfficeDev/office-js Issue #1509](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-js/issues/1509)). He included expected vs. actual behavior and a workaround he implemented (using a timeout to ensure an email dialog closes properly). Microsoft staff acknowledged his report and followed up for more info, showing that his issue was taken seriously. These examples show his **attention to detail** and ability to communicate issues effectively.

- **Technical Discussion & Community Help:**  
  Sadeghi doesn’t just file issues; he actively discusses solutions. In the **Vite** project issue about ESM support for Node built-ins, he responded to the project lead’s suggestion with a respectful but firm explanation ([Vite Issue #728](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/728)). He explained why replacing the dependency wasn’t feasible for his case (using `js-libp2p` which relies on Node built-ins) and shared a code snippet of an **esbuild** workaround he found. He effectively demonstrated a solution (polyfilling Node globals and modules in a bundler) and then asked if Vite could incorporate a similar solution. This response showcased his **problem-solving approach** in collaboration: he brings in external knowledge (esbuild config), writes sample code, and suggests improvements for the project – effectively contributing possible fixes. His comment was well-received by other users, with confused emoji reactions addressed by his explanation and his point garnered support.

- **Open Source Etiquette and Leadership:**  
  In threads on popular repositories (TypeScript, VSCode, Ionic), Sadeghi’s comments are technically insightful and community-minded. For instance, in the **TypeScript** issue about binding generic functions, he addressed a core team member (Ryan Cavanaugh) with a clear reference to a prior discussion (#6606) and a proposed syntax solution ([TypeScript Issue #37181](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/37181)). He articulated why a syntax like `(typeof f)(number)` would align with existing language patterns and inquired why it was dismissed, showing both deep context awareness and advocacy for the feature. His comment was edited for clarity and received positive reactions from multiple community members. In the **VSCode** repository, after an issue was closed as “as-designed”, he politely asked for clarification, citing a real use case: using the AVA test runner which outputs file:line:col but didn’t hyperlink in the terminal ([VSCode Issue #66957](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/66957)). He even included a screenshot to illustrate his point. A maintainer responded explaining why the behavior occurred. Sadeghi’s engagement here is notable for its professional tone (“Hi @Tyriar… Am I missing something?”) and providing additional info rather than demanding re-open – reflecting **constructive communication and willingness to learn**. In an **Ionic** framework bug thread, he chimed in with brief confirmations (“Same issue… when embedding the component”, and next day noting it affects `ion-header` too) ([Ionic Issue #15799](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/issues/15799)). This helped confirm the bug’s impact on multiple scenarios. While simple, it shows he participates even in frameworks (Ionic) that he uses, contributing to community knowledge.

- **Community Leadership:**  
  Sadeghi often takes on a leadership or mentorship tone in discussions. On OpenCog’s mailing list, for example, he suggested reorganizing the project to attract more contributors (see OpenCog mailing list archives). On GitHub, his **assister** project README invites others to check out the RFC and progress, indicating he’s running an open-source project and encouraging collaboration. He also interacts with other developers on Twitter/X and DEV.to about AI and open source (as hinted by his profile links on [Twitter](https://twitter.com) and [DEV.to](https://dev.to)). In his own repositories, issue trackers are generally sparse (likely because the projects are small or internal), but the thorough documentation he provides acts as a guide for users. His willingness to cross-link resources (e.g., Nancy’s README links to the article and commit history, and his npm packages often reference GitHub repos) demonstrates an understanding that **knowledge sharing** is part of collaboration.

Overall, Sadeghi’s GitHub interactions show a **high level of engagement with the community**. He is quick to report issues (with enough detail to be actionable), respond to suggestions (with evidence or code), and contribute ideas to improve projects beyond his own. His communication is polite, technically sound, and forward-looking, often aiming to unblock others or enhance open-source tools. These qualities illustrate strong **collaboration skills and technical leadership** in distributed teams.
