  <summary>1. Repositories & Contributions</summary>

**Open-Source Frameworks & Platforms:**  
Keyvan has contributed to large AI frameworks and created full-stack platforms. Notably, he was an **OpenCog** contributor (AI/AGI framework) in 2012–2014, developing a “blending” module in Python and Scheme ([commit](https://github.com/opencog/opencog/commit/90e5717)). He is listed as an official OpenCog author ([AUTHORS file](https://github.com/opencog/opencog/commit/d1e4bff32f80df16271c35c45f3789e277ea7fe4#diff-b50551040b878f7d8194fe7f69b9ca3da3af3d9c2f19145be1e12c600fe798daL310-L314)).

He co-authored **Agenda REST** ([repo](https://github.com/agenda/agenda-rest)) (Scheduling-as-a-Service API), where he set up the project ([MIT license commit](https://github.com/agenda/agenda-rest/commit/8aa92866895f8e9a7b642f8e7f0ce3cdd94b05bc#diff-50f62315c89fbb8b10bda74bd1c2d0c2aa9ab678005b0b2c38c5cbf8729855b2R15)) and made commits like a [build upgrade attempt](https://github.com/agenda/agenda-rest/commit/7863ec8).

Keyvan also **created the Koa-Neo4j framework** ([repo](https://github.com/keyvan-m-sadeghi/koa-neo4j)) (for Neo4j-backed REST APIs) during his work at MAPS, which is also published on NPM ([package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/koa-neo4j)).

**Assister:**  
More recently, he co-founded **Assister**, a private/open general assistant platform designed to provide a flexible, modular framework for building conversational AI applications. Detailed conceptual documentation explains its design and purpose, emphasizing its use as a unified platform to integrate chatbot UIs, Rasa NLU, and other natural language processing tools ([Assister Conception RFC](https://github.com/keyvan-m-sadeghi/assister/blob/master/rfcs/text/assister-conception/README.md)). He is the primary committer on this multi-package repository ([monorepo setup commit](https://github.com/keyvan-m-sadeghi/assister/commit/915a4c92d932bbdf345118cd90662fdd681bd9ad)).

**Functionland:**  
Most recently, Keyvan co-founded **Functionland**, an initiative focused on developing a decentralized personal cloud infrastructure. Functionland aims to provide users with a personal server experience using cutting-edge technologies like IPFS and libp2p, making data storage and access secure and independent. More details about this project and its crowdfunding efforts can be found on its [Indiegogo page](https://indiegogo.com/at/functionland).
